# Clocks

CS-210 Programming Languages

My goal was to develop an object-oriented programming (OOP) application to create two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input using secure and efficient C++ code. I needed to include theChada Tech Clocks Functional Requirements. I was also given a flowchart to graphically represent the logic needed to display the sequence of these functions. I was able to build and successfully run your clock program. The clock displayed correctly, and I was able to manipulate the time.
