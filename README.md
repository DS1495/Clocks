# Cplusplus-Program

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

My goal was to develop an object-oriented programming (OOP) application to create two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input using secure and efficient C++ code. I needed to include theChada Tech Clocks Functional Requirements. I was also given a flowchart to grapghically represent the logic needed to display the sequence of these functions.

#What did you do particularly well?

I was able to build and successfully run your clock program. The clock displayed correctly, and I was able to manipulate the time. The code itself was written well.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

My code could be enhanced by providing better comments to follow along my thought process.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The biggest challenge I faced was including all the variables needed to make this code work. I had spent a lot of time reveiwing the flowchart to make sure I included everything.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Well having a flowchart written and producing a code made me think in a different way than if I had made the flowchart myself. I was able to modularize the code into functions which greatly increased the efficiency of the code.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

C++ is maintable because unlike Python there is no stored variables. Everything is there to see and adjust and the logic behind it makes sense. However the C++ code tends to be longer because of this.
